### Project Description
This is an app designed to take pictures of physical and digital notes from college lectures and store them in a specific directory that won't interfere with Android's default photo gallery. Later, the user (a college student like me) can view those notes through the app's implementation for viewing photos. Ideally, the user can use this app without needing wifi or data access, like on long commutes by metro system.

### Process through Development
This is my second Android project that was designed as a slightly deeper dive into Android app programming and object oriented programming.
My motivation was to both make a proof of concept for a streamlined note collecting app, and to figure out how to use some more of Android's systems like FileProviders and using internal storage. A more general purpose was also to give myself another chance to go through the process of creating a project from idea to design to implementation.
